## 🔭 Vision

To become the leading infrastructure for automated financial data in Latin America, known for reliability, innovation and independence.

## 💎 Values

- **Reliability:** Accurate data — or none at all.
- **Transparency:** All information must be traceable and verifiable.
- **Autonomy:** Intelligent agents, each with their own responsibility.
- **Simplicity:** From design to code — less is more.
- **Scalability:** We start small but aim for millions of daily requests.
- **Ethics & Fairness:** We do not engage in abusive or unfair scraping practices. We respect usage terms and act fairly with clients, public entities and partners.

---

## ⚖️ Ethical Commitment

nimbvs is committed to building and maintaining automated systems that respect the legal and ethical boundaries of public data usage.

We do not perform abusive scraping practices, and we always prioritize formal integrations, official APIs, and full transparency in our data extraction methods.

We believe that trust is built through responsibility — that’s why all our virtual agents operate within secure, auditable and fair parameters.
